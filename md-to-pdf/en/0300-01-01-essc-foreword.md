"Assisting local governments towards disaster risk reduction: 
Training on participatory mapping and use of decision support tools"
of the Environmental Science for Social Change in partnership with 
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) 
supported by the World Bank-East Asia Pacific and Global Facility 
for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (WB-GFDRR).

About the project
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Institute of Environmental Science for Social Change [http://essc.org.ph/](http://essc.org.ph/) 
is a Jesuit research organization in the Philippines that promotes 
environmental sustainability and social justice through the integration 
of scientific methodologies and social processes.  It is implementing an 
initial six-month work activity that will contribute to the initiative of 
the Department of Interior and Local Government in assisting the country’s 
most vulnerable local governments gain more resilience to the harsh effect 
of disasters.

The Institute will take the lead in providing training on participatory mapping 
to selected local governments in flood-prone areas by using OpenStreetMap tools 
for effective community engagement and data collection and maintenance.  
Volunteers from OpenStreetMap-Philippines will be joining the Institute as 
co-trainors.  This opportunity also assists OpenStreetMap gain broader visibility.

The Institute will also customize InaSAFE, a free software that produces realistic 
natural hazard impact scenarios, for use in the Philippine context, specifically 
catering to the needs and realities of the initial set of selected local governments. 
InaSAFE stands for Indonesia Scenario Assessment For Emergencies, and is used across 
the country for better planning, preparedness and response activities, formulation of 
contingency plans, and community-based disaster risk management.

Background
-------------

The Philippines is ranked third out of 173 countries in terms of vulnerability to 
disaster risks and natural hazards (World Risk Index 2011, United Nations 
University-Institute for Environment and Human Security).  Given this high-risk 
status, greater initiatives on local disaster risk reduction and management 
and comprehensive place-specific hazard assessments are critical and urgent.

A major element in effectively minimizing risks during extreme weather events 
at the local level is the capacity of local governments to effectively respond 
to the various phases of disaster events (pre-, during, and post-).  
Contributing to this is the use of decision support tools that enables the 
use of data from responsible national agencies and from local updated information.

It is in this context that the Institute was invited to partner with the 
World Bank’s East Asia Pacific Disaster Risk Management portfolio and the 
Department of Interior and Local Government to implement a six-month project 
on Participatory mapping and LGU decision support tools for disaster risk reduction.

The East Asia Pacific Disaster Risk Management portfolio of the World Bank is 
rapidly expanding in the area of highly technical disaster and climate risk 
assessments with core components related to building resilience through better 
decision making, especially for infrastructure investments.  East Asia Pacific 
has several cutting-edge programs including Building Urban Resilience with the 
InaSAFE risk information decision tool.  EAP works in close partnership with the 
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery on the Open Data for Resilience 
Initiative, which aims to reduce the impact of disasters by empowering decision-makers 
with better information and the tools to support their decisions. 

Project Objectives
---------------------

The project will provide training on participatory mapping and InaSAFE support 
to the Philippine government in disaster risk reduction activities, 
specifically through these strategies:

* Supporting the growth of the OpenStreetMap community that has competence 
  in leveraging participatory mapping methods with OpenStreetMap tools and 
  Web-based map platforms and is a proven effective approach to community 
  engagement and in obtaining data.
* Supporting the customization of InaSAFE that will leverage the InaSAFE 
  initiative with the decision support tool component of the project, 
  having been developed and implemented in Indonesia so far.  The 
  Department of Interior and Local Government identified InaSAFE’s 
  potential in assisting local governments design their contingency 
  and land use plans.

About ESSC 
------------------------------

The Institute of Environmental Science for Social Change [http://essc.org.ph/](http://essc.org.ph/) 
is a Jesuit research organization in the Philippines that promotes environmental

and social processes. 

Integration with the institutional work program on risk resilience
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This effort is a critical contribution to the institutional work program of the 
Environmental Science for Social Change on risk resilience that is undertaken 
in collaboration with partners who seek ways to reduce the risks of weather 
events when these trigger geomorphologic hazards such as floods, landslides, 
and drought.

The work requires an active engagement with local communities, national and 
local government, faith-based organizations, educators, professionals, media, 
academe, and other civil society organizations so that we contribute to the 
development of emerging structures that assist “centres of living and learning” 
across Asia Pacific and sustain engagements in disaster risk reduction.  
There are three major elements in the Institute’s approach to the risk 
resilience work program:

* Learning, to improve understanding of natural hazards and related 
  risks through scientific analysis and disaster risk assessment
* Creating, to develop capacity for risk reduction through 
  social preparedness
* Accompanying, to build a regional network of partners and 
  collaborators who contribute to dialogue and exchange on 
  disaster risk reduction and management

As the Institute envisions a trusting and empowering society 
working for sustainable resource management, ecological services, 
and human security, there is a critical need to develop environmental 
mechanisms with communities and local governments in the Philippines to 
promote appropriate resource management and implementation.  Such a goal 
requires harnessing the Institute’s full complement of its competence and 
capacities in resource mapping, geomatics, landscape and watershed analysis, 
social analysis, and communications, thus ensuring that we are of service to 
those in need.
