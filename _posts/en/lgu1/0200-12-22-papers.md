Surveying with Field Papers
=============================

In this chapter we will see how we can record the coordinates of places
without a GPS. We will use a tool called [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/), 
which allows you to print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes, and load 
the paper back into JOSM, where you can add your locations to OpenStreetMap.

Overview of Field Papers
--------------------------

Before we go into detail about Field Papers, let's look at an
overview of how the process works:

1. Locate the area you want to map on the Field Papers
website. Print out a map of this area. You can choose to print the
current map of the area on OpenStreetMap, or you can choose to print
aerial imagery, if it is available in your area.

![Field papers homepage][]

2. Use your printed map to survey the area. Add more places by
drawing them on the map. Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and
so forth. Write notes about each location directly on the map, or write
numbers on the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you
can write more detailed information about each object.

3. Scan your paper into the computer. If you don't have a
scanner, you can take a photograph of the paper, if your camera is able
to take high quality pictures. Upload the image to the Field Papers
website. [http://fieldpapers.org/upload.php](http://fieldpapers.org/upload.php)

4. In JOSM, load the Field Papers.  Use the objects you draw as
a reference to add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.

How does Field Papers work?
-----------------------------

If you follow the Field Papers process described above, you will be
collecting accurate geographic coordinates of places with nothing more
than paper. How is this possible?

![Paper QR code][]

When you print a Field Paper, the paper comes with a square barcode on
the bottom of the page. This bar code allows Field Papers to determine
the exact location of the map that you are using to survey. Later, when
you load the paper back into JOSM, all the objects that you drew will be
shown in their actual locations. It's like using a GPS to collect precise
coordinates, except all you need is paper!

Now let's learn how to create and use Field Papers.

Create and Print
----------------

-   Open your web browser. In the address bar at the top of the window,
    enter the following text and press Enter:
    [fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org)
-   The website should look something like this:

    ![Field papers homepage][]

-   Click **Make yourself an Atlas** to select the area you want to print out.

	![Make atlas][]
	
    You will be directed to this page:
	
	![Atlas][]
	
	Type the name of the area of interest in the space provided. Then click "Start there".

-   The map that you see shows the area that you would like to print on
    paper. You can move the map the same way you move the map on the
    OpenStreetMap website, using your left mouse button to drag the map,
    and your scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
    Left-clicking on the (+) and (â€“) buttons in the upper left corner will
    also zoom in and out.
	
	![Zoom in/out][]
	
-   Just above the map are some additional options. The first option is
    to select the orientation of the paper you want to use for printing the
	Field Paper. You may choose either portrait or landscape.
	
	![Choose tile][]
	
-   The next option lets you select the kind of data you want to use
    for your Field Paper. Here you can select from different options
	that will change how the map looks. For now, we will select
	Black and White. 

	![Black and white][]
	
-   You want to make sure that the window shows the area that you want to
	map. You can use the controls in the map window to resize the pages of
	your Field Paper, or to more or fewer pages. Be sure that your papers cover
	a reasonably small area, or they won't be of much use when you are walking
	around. If you make mistakes the first time, don't worry, you can create
	as many papers as you need.
	
	![Zoom][]
	
-   Let's make the print now! If you have found the area you are
    interested in mapping and have selected the options that make your
    paper look good, you are ready. Click the button labelled "Next",
    next to the dropdown box.
	
	![Label next][]
	
-	Provide a name for the paper. If you like, you can add text which will appear
	on each paper that is printed.

	![Name][]
	
-	The next option lets you select a layout. It comes with three options.
	You may add a UTM grid overlay to each map if you want to. In most cases,
	you can select "Maps Only", which is already selected by default.
	
	![Layout][]
	
-   Click "Finished!". You will see that your new print is being
	processed. When it is finished, you will see your Field Paper on this
    page. It usually only takes a few minutes for a print to be ready, depending
	on how many pages you are creating.

    ![Paper prepare print][]

-   When your print is ready, click "Download map PDF for print". The
    Field Paper should begin downloading.
	
	![Download pdf][]
	
-   When the download is finished, open the PDF file. Connect your
    computer to a printer and print the page. If everything goes well,
    you should now have your map printed on paper.

Map with Field Papers
-----------------------

-   Take your Field Paper outside, and use it as a guide to walk and
    identify new places that are not on the map.
-   Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and so forth. Write
    notes about each location directly on the map, or write numbers on
    the map that relate to numbers in your notebook, where you can write
    more detailed information about each object.
-   When you are satisfied with your additions on the paper map, then
    you can add them digitally into OpenStreetMap.

Scan and Upload
---------------

-   Field Papers are very useful for mapping with nothing more than
    paper, but they are not 100% magic. We will still need to add our
    paper into JOSM, add our information digitally, and save our changes
    on OpenStreetMap.
-   The first step is to scan your Field Papers into your computer. You
    can do this by attaching a scanner to your computer, scanning the
    paper, and saving it as an image file. If you don't have a scanner,
    you can take a photography of the paper, but you should be careful
    to take a very good photo. Make sure that the paper is flat and your
    camera is directly in front of it. Be sure to include the barcode in
    the image, as Field Papers will not work without it. Here is an
    example of a scanned/photographed image:

    ![Paper example 2][]

-   Once you have your Field Paper scanned and saved on the computer,
    open your web browser and return to fieldpapers.org, just as
    before.
-   Click on the "Upload" tab.

	![Upload][]
	
-   Click "Choose File" and navigate to the file where you
    scanned/photographed your Field Papers.
	
	![Paper upload 1][]
	
-   Click "Upload"
-   It may take a few minutes for your paper to upload, depending on the
    speed of your internet connection. When the upload finishes, you will
	see something like this:

    ![Paper upload 2][]

Add the Field Papers Plugin
------------
-	Before we can open the Field Paper in JOSM, we need to install the
	JOSM Field Papers plugin.
-	Open JOSM and go to Edit -> Preferences.
-	Click on the Plugins tab.
- 	Find the Field Papers plugin and check the box next to it. Click Ok.

	![Field papers plugin][]

- Restart JOSM.

Open in JOSM
------------

-   Now you can load your Field Paper into JOSM
    and use it to add your information to OpenStreetMap. Return to the
    Field Papers website, by typing
    [fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org/) in your web
    browser, just as before.
-   Click "Watch" tab then click "Snapshots" tab.
-   Find your paper from the list, and click on it. You should see
    something like this:

    ![Paper scanned][]

-   To load the paper into JOSM, we need to copy the snapshot ID of the Field
    Papers you have scanned. In the URL bar at the top of your internet
    browser, select the text and press CTRL+C on your keyboard to copy.
    The text should look similar to this:
    [http://fieldpapers.org/snapshot.php?id=zqw8m33x#16/14.6582/121.1098](http://fieldpapers.org/snapshot.php?id=zqw8m33x#16/14.6582/121.1098)
	
	![Field paper id][]
	
-   On the top menu of JOSM, Click "Field Papers". Then click "Scanned
    Map..."
	
	![Scanned map][]
	
-   Press CTRL+V on your keyboard to paste the text that you copied from
    the Field Papers website.
	
	![F snapshot][]
	
-   Click OK.
-   If all went well, you should see your Field Paper load into JOSM.
    In the next chapter, we will see how to add the places that you
    mapped into OpenStreetMap.

	![Field paper josm][]

You can also use your scanned Field Papers in other OSM online editors 
such as iD or Potlatch2 by clicking the "Edit in iD" or "Edit in Potlatch"
links in the scanned Field Papers page. 

![Edit in id or pot][]

Repeat!
-------

-   After you add your changes to OSM, they will be saved on the
    map. Then the next time you want to improve the map, you can print
    out a new Field Papers which will include the changes that you
    made. As this process is repeated, the map will get better and
    better, the more you map!

Summary
-------

Congratulations! In this chapter you learned the process of using
Field Papers and how they work. You learned how to print, map, and
scan a Field Paper, and how you can use them to improve OpenStreetMap.
In the next chapter, we will learn how to add the
places that we mapped into OpenStreetMap, and you will have learned the
complete process of editing the map.
